You might notice that there’s a toggle when you select on object in the game to make the object dynamic or not.

### **What is a Dynamic Object?**

A dynamic object is an object that can actively interact within the game environment. This capability is determined by the type of collider assigned to the object.

### **The Role of the Dynamic Toggle**

- **Dynamic vs. Static Collider**: When you select an object in Soba, you'll see an option to toggle the object as dynamic. Turning this toggle on changes the object's collider from static to dynamic.
- **Behavioral Dynamics**: [Objects with behaviors](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/managing-behaviors/preset-behavior) (like movement or interaction capabilities) are naturally dynamic. They can be manipulated or can interact during the game's runtime.
- **Creating Dynamic Objects Without Inherent Behavior**: Sometimes, you might want an object to interact with the player even if it doesn’t have its own behavior scripted. For instance, you could set up a scenario where a [player](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/working-with-players/random-player) collides with an object to trigger an action. In these cases, making the object dynamic is essential, even though the behavior is coded on the player side, not the object.
- **Necessity for Dynamic Setting**: Certain behaviors, especially those involving player-object interactions, require the object to be dynamic. Without this setting, these interactions won’t function as intended.

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Impact on Game Efficiency**: Dynamic objects, due to their interactive nature, demand more processing power. They require constant calculation for interactions and physics, which can impact the game's overall performance.
- **Default Non-Dynamic Setting**: To optimize performance and ensure smooth gameplay, objects are set to non-dynamic by default (objects with behaviors will automatically become dynamic). Turning an object dynamic should be a deliberate choice, based on its intended role in the game.
