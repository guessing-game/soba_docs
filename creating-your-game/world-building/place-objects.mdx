Adding objects to your game is super easy. 

1. Tap on the “Create” button, then “Create new game” and choose your [template](https://wiki.soba.xyz/creating-your-game/general/what-template).
2. On the right-hand side of your screen, you'll find a wide array of objects provided by [Soba](soba.xyz), specifically designed for game creation.
3. Tap on the object you want to add to your game. You can either tap anywhere in your world view to place it, or hold and drag it to where you’d like it.
