Enhancing the mood or environment of your game can be an important step in making the game ‘your own’ and impact significantly the player's experience. Here's how to do it:

### **Accessing and Using the Mood Device**

- **Locating the Mood Device**: Once in the game, find the mood device next to the player’s plate.
- **Exploring Preset Behaviors**: Tap on the mood device to view a variety of [pre-built behavior](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/managing-behaviors/preset-behavior)
. You can select and modify these to alter your game's backdrop.
- **Biomes**: The game world includes four distinct biomes, each with unique mood switches:
    - Lava Zone
    - Forest Zone
    - Snow Zone
    - City Zone

### **Creating Custom Moods**

You can create your own custom mood in addition to using presets.

1. **Select the Mood Device**: Tap on the mood device or any object in the game.
2. **Open Details**: Tap on “Details”.
3. **Add Behavior**: Select “Add a Behavior”.
4. **Choose Trigger**: For a mood that starts with the game, select “Game Starts” from the Trigger Section.
5. **Modify Player Environment**: In the “Effects” section, under “Player Environment”, you can:
    - **Set Player’s Sky**: Choose horizon color, clouds, stars, and their intensity.
    - **Set Horizon**: Adjust the color of the horizon, sky intensity, and skyline.
    - **Set Sun**: Determine the time of day, sun intensity, and color.
    - **Set Weather**: Choose between Rain, Snow, Cyber Rain, and Cyber Rainbow.
    - **Set Fog**: Add fog and adjust its thickness.

### **Editing Tips for Moods**

- **Use a Hex Color Picker**: This tool helps visualize the backdrop [colors](https://wiki.soba.xyz/creating-your-game/world-building/color) more accurately.
