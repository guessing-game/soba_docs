While objects come with standard colors, altering them to fit your game's aesthetic is super simple. Here’s how to do it:

1. Tap on the [object](https://wiki.soba.xyz/creating-your-game/world-building/dynamic-object) you wish to re-color.
2. Tap on the “Details” button located on the left-hand panel.
3. In the panel that appears on the right, navigate to the color section. You’ll see a square representing the current color of the object.
4. Tap on this color square to open a panel displaying a range of color options.
5. Choose your desired color from the palette. The object’s color will instantly update to reflect your choice.
