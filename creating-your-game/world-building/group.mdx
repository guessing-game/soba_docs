If you select two or more objects, you can group them together. Here’s how to do it: 

1. Begin by tapping on one of the objects you wish to group.
2. Tap on the multiselect button, located at the top left of the screen. This allows you to select multiple objects.
3. Tap on the other objects you want to include in your group. Then, tap on the “Grouped” button. Now, any movement or transformation you apply will affect the entire group.
4. If you want to create a copy of the entire group, use the “Duplicate” button found on the left-hand panel.
5. If you need to work on a single object within a group, tap on that object while the group is selected. This action focuses on the selected object. To return to the group, tap on the focused object again, and it will revert to the group selection.

### **Ungrouping Objects**

1. **Select the Group**: Tap on the grouped objects you wish to ungroup.
2. **Ungroup**: Simply tap on the “Grouped” button again. The objects will no longer be treated as a single unit.
