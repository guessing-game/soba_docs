You're creating a game and you're wondering what the buttons do? Here's an explanation:

### When no Object is selected:

- Top Left corner
    - **Orange Hamburger menu**: opens a menu with the following options:
        - **Orange button** - tap it if you want to leave the [editor](https://wiki.soba.xyz/creating-your-game/general/behavior-editor) and return to your creations screen.
        - **Posting setting** - opens a view from where you can post, name and set [thumbnails](https://wiki.soba.xyz/creating-your-game/managing-your-game/thumbnail) for your game.
        - **Multiplayer settings** - opens a view from where you can decide whether you game is a single- or a [multiplayer](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/game-logic/multiplayer) and adjust max and min players.
        - **Game rules** - opens a view from where you can set time limits, scores and leaderboards.

- Bottom Right:
    - **Arrows** ↩️ **and** ↪: tap them to *Undo* or *Redo* any action you did in the world.
    - **Play** ▶️: Tap this Button to Playtest your game.

### When an Object or Group is selected:

- Top Left corner:
    - **Multiselecting**: allows you to select different objects and then you can perform actions on all of them.
    - **Grouping**: when you have a few objects selected with Multi-select, you can group these objects together.
    - **Duplicating**: you can create an identical copy of an object or a group of objects next to, above, or below the selected object or group of objects
    - **Details**: open a menu with more object properties on the right part of the screen.
- Bottom Left corner:
    - **Delete**: you can delete the selected object or group of objects.
- Floating transform panel on the selected object or group of objects:
    - **Scale** objects by holding down the [scale](https://wiki.soba.xyz/creating-your-game/world-building/transform) button: move it right to make objects bigger, left to make them smaller.
        - when tapped (the color of the button is white) - additional scaling options would appear to scale the object in X, Y, Z directions. Only works for a single object.
    - **Rotate** around the Y-axis by holding down the rotate button.
        - when tapped (the color of the button is white) - additional rotating options would appear to rotate the object in X, Y, Z directions. Works for both a single object and a group of objects.
    - **Move** objects by holding down the move button.
        - when tapped (the color of the button is white) - additional moving options would appear to move the object in X, Y, Z directions. Works for both a single object and a group of objects.
