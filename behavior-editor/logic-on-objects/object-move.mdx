<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your object">
  <Accordion title="The basics for all behaviors">
    1. Tap on the object to which you want to add a [behavior](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/managing-behaviors/behavior-object)
    2. With the object selected, tap on the “Details” button to the left of your screen.

    3. In the Details panel, tap “Add Behavior”.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your Trigger">
    Drag the “Game Start” trigger block into the Behavior Editor. You can also select whatever other trigger you want.
  </Step>
  
<Step title="Create a Loop">
    We want the object to move during the entire game. So in the “Controllers” section, select the [loop](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/managing-behaviors/loop-behavior) “Infinitely” and drag it below the trigger.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply First Object Action">
    In “Object Action”, drag the “Move Towards” block and place it inside the "Infinitely” loop. Toggle the node and change the [coordinates](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/logic-on-objects/object-coordinates) as you wish. For instance, change the X value to 5 to make the object move on the x axis from its current position. You can also customise the speed. 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Second Object Action">
    For the object to go back in its position, add another block “Move Towards” and apply the same value but negative for the object to resume its position (ie -5 on the x axis) 
     <Accordion title="Behavior Image">

      </p>
  </Accordion>
  </Step>

     <Step title="Playtest!">
    After setting up the movements, test your game to see how the object behaves and make adjustments for the perfect effect.
  </Step>
