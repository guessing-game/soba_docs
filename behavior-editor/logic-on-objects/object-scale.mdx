  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your Trigger">
    Decide on the action that will trigger the [appearance](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/logic-on-objects/object-appear) and disappearance. If you want your object to continuously appear and disappear right from the onset of the game, opt for the "Game Start" trigger. This will ensure the effect begins as soon as gameplay starts.
  </Step>
   <Step title="Set your Loop">
    To have the object consistently appear and disappear, go to the “Controllers” tab. Select and drag the “Infinitely” [loop](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/managing-behaviors/loop-behavior) block, placing it below the trigger.
  </Step>
   <Step title="Scale your object up">
    In the “Object Action” tab, drag the “Scale Object” block into the “Infinitely” loop. Adjust the block settings, increasing the X, Y, and Z coordinate values to scale the object up 
  </Step>
     <Step title="Add Wait Time">
    Insert a “Wait” block for a 1-second pause before scaling up again.
  </Step>
     <Step title="Scale your object down">
    Add another “Scale Object” block below the first one. Toggle this block and decrease the values of all coordinates to scale the object down. Add a Wait Node to add 1 second before the object scales up again. Drag it below Object action. 
  </Step>
    <Step title="Add Wait Time">
    Insert a “Wait” block for a 1-second pause before scaling up again.
