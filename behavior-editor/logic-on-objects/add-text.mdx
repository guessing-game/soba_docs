    3. In the Details panel, tap “Add Behavior”.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your Trigger">
    Choose what you want the trigger to be. For instance, it could be that when the player [interacts](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/working-with-players/player-teleport#how-to-teleport-players-through-interactions) with the object, the text appears. To do that, drag the “Interaction” trigger block into the Behavior Editor. You can select whatever other trigger you want.
  </Step>
  
<Step title="Add Text">
    In the “Effect” section, drag the “Text on Object” block and place it below your trigger. Toggle the node and change the text as you wish. You can also change the position of the text and the duration of the text. 
    <Accordion title="Behavior Image">

      </p>
  </Accordion>
  </Step>

     <Step title="Playtest!">
    After setting up the movements, test your game to see how the object behaves and make adjustments for the perfect effect.
