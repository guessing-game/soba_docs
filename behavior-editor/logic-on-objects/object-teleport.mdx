Making your objects teleport can add a lot of dynamism in your game. Here are the steps to do it!

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your object">
  <Accordion title="The basics for all behaviors">
    1. Tap on the object to which you want to add a [behavior](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/managing-behaviors/behavior-object)
    2. With the object selected, tap on the “Details” button to the left of your screen.

    3. In the Details panel, tap “Add Behavior”.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your Trigger">
    Decide what will trigger the behavior. In this case, we are using “Interaction" so the behavior will be triggered when the player interacts with the object.
  </Step>
   <Step title="Add Object Action">
    Go to the “Object Actions” section, select the "Set Object Position" block, and set the coordinates for the [teleport](https://sobastudios.mintlify.app/behavior-editor/game-logic/teleport). Alternatively, you can build a custom logic with further data by tapping on the "Position" number and, instead of typing something, selecting "Add Custom Graphs" at the bottom of your screen.  
    <Accordion title="Behavior Image">

      </p>
  </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Your Custom Graph">
    On the right hand tab, go to the last of the Sources nodes and select "Object Sources". Then, in the right-hand tap, go to "Operators". Search for "Object Position". Connect the three of them like the sequence below.

      </p>
  </Accordion>
 </Step>

  <Step title="Select Where Your Object Will Teleport">
    On "Editor Object Sources" [node](https://sobastudios.mintlify.app/behavior-editor/general/nodes-list), tap on the cube to the right and select the object you want to teleport your object to, and confirm the selection.
    
  </Step>
   <Step title="Playtest!">
     After setting up the movements, test your game to see how the object behaves and make adjustments for the perfect effect.
  </Step>
  </Steps>
