  <Step title="Set your Trigger">
    Decide on the action that will trigger the appearance and disappearance. If you want your object to continuously appear and disappear right from the onset of the game, opt for the "Game Start" trigger. This will ensure the effect begins as soon as gameplay starts.

   <Step title="Scale Down">
    In the “Object Action” section, drag the “Scale Object” block into the “Infinitely” loop. Adjust the block settings, setting X, Y, and Z coordinates to 0 to scale the object down until it disappears.
  </Step>
     <Step title="Add Wait Time">
    Insert a “Wait” block for a 1-second pause before scaling up again.
  </Step>
     <Step title="Rescale to original size">
    Add another “Scale Object” block below the first one. Toggle this block and set all axes to 1, allowing the object to return to its original size and reappear.
