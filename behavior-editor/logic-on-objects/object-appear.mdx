    3. In the Details panel, tap “Add Behavior”.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set your Trigger">
    Decide on the action that will trigger the appearance and disappearance. If you want your object to continuously appear and disappear right from the onset of the game, opt for the "Game Start" trigger. This will ensure the effect begins as soon as gameplay starts.
  </Step>
   <Step title="Set your Loop">
    To have the object consistently appear and disappear, go to the “Controllers” section. Select and drag the “Infinitely” loop block, placing it below the trigger.
  </Step>
   <Step title="Scale Down">
    In the “Object Action” section, drag the “Scale Object” block into the “Infinitely” loop. Adjust the block settings, setting X, Y, and Z coordinates to 0 to scale the object down until it disappears.
  </Step>
     <Step title="Add Wait Time">
    Insert a “Wait” block for a 1-second pause before scaling up again.
  </Step>
     <Step title="Rescale to original size">
    Add another “Scale Object” block below the first one. Toggle this block and set all axes to 1, allowing the object to return to its original size and reappear.
  </Step>
    <Step title="Add Wait Time">
    Insert a “Wait” block for a 1-second pause before scaling up again.
