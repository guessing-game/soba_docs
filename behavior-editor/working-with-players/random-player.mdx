  <Step title="Second Step">
Decide what will trigger the behavior. This could be an action like a collision, an interaction, or the game starting. Select a “Trigger” box and drag it into the editor.

<Step title="Third Step">
Navigate to the controller blocks (Game Actions, Object, Effects, and Miscellaneous) and select your desired action. To pick a random player for that action, tap on "Player: Graph” and edit it such as if you were picking “All Players", shuffling them in a list with “Shuffle Players” and then picking the first result that comes with it using the “Pick first Player” node. Connect the resulting player to the 'Player’ node. Follow the image below for further instructions.
