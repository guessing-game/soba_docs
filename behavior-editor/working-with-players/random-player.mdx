</Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
Decide what will trigger the behavior. This could be an action like a collision, an interaction, or the game starting. Select a “Trigger” box and drag it into the editor. 
 </Step>
<Step title="Third Step">
Navigate to the controller [blocks](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/general/blocks) (Game Actions, Object, Effects, and Miscellaneous) and select your desired action. To pick a random player for that action, tap on "Player: Graph” and edit it such as if you were picking “All Players", shuffling them in a list with “Shuffle Players” and then picking the first result that comes with it using the “Pick first Player” node. Connect the resulting player to the 'Player’ [node](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/general/nodes-list). Follow the image below for further instructions.
