### How to teleport players through interactions?

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
<Accordion title="The basics for all behaviors">
    1. Click on the asset to which you want to add a behavior
    2. With the object selected, click on the “Details” button to the left of your screen.

    3. In the Details panel, click “Add Behavior”.
</Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
Decide what will trigger the behavior. In this case, we are using “Interaction", which shows a button when getting closer to the object that the behavior is added to.

 </Step>
<Step title="Third Step">
Go to the “Game Actions” section, select the “Set Player Position” block, and set the coordinates for the teleport. Alternatively, you can build a custom logic with further data by tapping on the position number and, instead of typing something, selecting “Add custom graphs’” For example, setting the teleport position to an object in your game (see custom graph image below).
