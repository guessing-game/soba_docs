To fine-tune your game's actions, adjusting the default values of your [blocks](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/general/blocks) is key.

Take the “Wait” block as an example: it has a preset duration, but how long should it actually wait? Every block comes with a default setting, but you can customize it to better fit your game's needs.

Here's how to change values:

1. Expand the Block: Click on the arrow on the right side of the block. This will reveal the block's specific parameters.
2. Edit the Parameter: Click on the parameter's input field.
3. Enter New Value: A keyboard will pop up, allowing you to type in the desired value for that parameter.
