Now that Blocks and parameters are covered, let’s go a level deeper.

Suppose you aim to reposition your object. With Blocks, you're limited to specifying a precise location using a numerical value.

But what if you want your object to mimic the position of another object within the game world? This is achievable through custom graphs! Custom graphs allow for the creation of conditions and the performance of calculations and operations using the available data.

## To add a custom graph you need to:
1. Expand your block
2. Pick the parameter you want to create your logic
3. Tap on the input field related to the parameter
4. On top of the keyboard, tap on “Add Custom Graph”

You will be redirected to a new screen - your custom graph!

Check “What are nodes” to understand how they work.
