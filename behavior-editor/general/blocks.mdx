title: 'What are Blocks?'
description: 'Adding blocks to your game is the first step to creating logic on Soba.'
---
The new behavior editor in our platform utilizes a block programming approach, where each block is like a puzzle piece. These blocks connect to form a column, with each piece representing a command for the object you're programming.

Consider this example to understand how the execution works:

    <p align="center">

Here, the trigger is “Player Touches Object”, which means the execution starts when the player comes into contact with the object. Following this trigger, the object will first spin, and then a particle effect animation will play on it.


## Types of blocks

### Triggers

Triggers are the starting point on your canvas, initiating a sequence of commands (execution steps) and defining the conditions for subsequent blocks to activate. Each execution column can have only one trigger.

### Actions

An action is the resulting event that occurs in your game world, but an action block only functions when connected to a trigger. Placing an action block without a trigger means it won't activate.

### Controllers

Controllers add specific rules to your execution, but actions must be placed within a controller block to be effective.

For example a loop controller will loop all the action blocks added inside of it.

## Now let's put this into practice!

Let's say that we want an object to spin three times upon interaction.

<Steps>
<Step title="Select your object">
  <Accordion title="The basics for all behaviors">
    1. Tap on the object to which you want to add a behavior
    2. With the object selected, tap on the “Details” button to the left of your screen.

    3. In the Details panel, tap “Add Behavior”.
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Trigger">
    Choose a trigger of your choice. If you want your action to be triggered by the player interacting with your object, choose the "Interaction" trigger. 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Controller">
    This is where we add in our loop function. To have the object spin 3 times, go to the “Controllers” section. Select and drag the "N Times" Controllers and drag it below your trigger.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Object Action">
    In the “Object Action” section, drag the “Spin” block below your controller block. Adjust the block settings as you wish.
