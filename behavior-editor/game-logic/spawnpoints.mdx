<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
<Accordion title="The basics for all behaviors">

</Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
Decide what will trigger the behavior. This could be an action like a collision, an interaction, or the game starting. Select a “Trigger” box and drag it into the editor. 
 </Step>
<Step title="Third Step">
Navigate to the “Game Actions” section and select the “Set player position” block. Tap on the Player “Graph” button and set the player being affected by the trigger.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Fourth Step">
For the different spawn points, you’ll need to build [custom logic](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/general/custom-graphs). Tap on the position number and select “Add Custom Graphs”:
  <Accordion title="1. Start by creating an Object list variable">

      </p>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Connect your [nodes](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/general/nodes-list) so that when the object list is shuffled, a position is picked, converted into coordinates, and then used as the final teleport destination (as illustrated below)">
