There are two ways to make your players teleport across positions. One is using the teleport object, and the other is by using behavior editor. We'll teach both ways in the information below.

### Using the teleport object:
1. Browse through the last category of [objects](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/managing-behaviors/preset-behavior).
2. Find the teleport object and place it on your map.

4. Exit the creator mode and test it!

### Using the behavior editor:
<Steps>

<Accordion title="The basics for all behaviors">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
Decide what will trigger the behavior. This could be an action like a collision or an interaction. Select a “Trigger” box and drag it into the editor.  
 </Step>
<Step title="Third Step">
Navigate to the “Game Actions” section, select the 'Set Player Position’ block, and set the coordinates for the checkpoint. You can also build custom logic with further data by tapping on the “Graph” button next to Position. Instead of typing something, select “Add Custom Graphs”. This example below will set the [teleport](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/working-with-players/player-teleport) position to an object in your game.
