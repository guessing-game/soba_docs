  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
Decide what will trigger the behavior. This could be an action like a collision, an interaction, or players entering a game. Select a “Trigger” box and drag it into the editor. 
 </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
To start, navigate to the “Game Actions” section. Here, select the “Set Maximum Health” node and set the maximum health players will have in your game.
 </Step>
<Step title="Fourth Step">
To adjust player health, start by adding a new Trigger. Then, in the "Game Actions" section, choose the "Increment Health" block. For instance, use 'Increment Health' to challenge players to manage their [health](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/game-logic/health#how-to-add-or-deduct-health-from-a-player) for survival and success. You can even input a negative value, like "-100", to reduce health. Other useful blocks include Kill Player, Increment Lives, Set Health, Set Maximum Lives, and Set Lives, allowing for diverse health mechanics customization in your game.
