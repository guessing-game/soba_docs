### How to add effects or particles to my game?

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
<Accordion title="The basics for all behaviors">
   1. Tap on the object to which you want to add a [behavior](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/managing-behaviors/behavior-object)
    2. With the object selected, tap on the “Details” button to the left of your screen.

    3. In the Details panel, tap “Add Behavior”.
</Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
Decide what will trigger the behavior. This could be an action like a collision, an interaction, or the game starting. Select a “Trigger” box and drag it into the editor.  
 </Step>
<Step title="Third Step">
Navigate to the “Effects” section and then select any particle effect you want. In the example below, a smoke particle is played 3 times in an object when the game starts. That was done by navigating to the [“Controllers”](https://wiki.soba.xyz/behavior-editor/general/blocks#controllers) section and picking the block ‘N Times’, and then adding inside of it the block ‘Play Particle Effect’ from the “Effects” section.
