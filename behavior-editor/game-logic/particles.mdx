### How to add effects or particles to my game?

    3. In the Details panel, click “Add Behavior”.
</Accordion>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
Decide what will trigger the behavior. This could be an action like a collision, an interaction, or the game starting. Select a “Trigger” box and drag it into the editor.  
 </Step>
<Step title="Third Step">
Navigate to the “Effects” section and then select any particle effect you want. In the example below, a smoke particle is played 3 times in an object when the game starts. That was done by navigating to the “Controllers” section and picking the block ‘N Times’, and then adding inside of it the block ‘Play Particle Effect’ from the “Effects” section.
