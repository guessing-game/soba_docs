  <Step title="Set your Trigger">
    Decide what will trigger the behavior. This could be an action like a collision, an interaction, or the game starting. Select a “Trigger” block of your choice and drag it onto the canvas. 
  </Step>
  
<Step title="Set Object Action">
    In the sidebar, go to the “Object Actions” tab. Here, choose the specific block you want your object to perform when triggered. For example, you might select a bouncing or [moving](https://sobastudios.mintlify.app/behavior-editor/logic-on-objects/object-move) action. Select a block of your choice and attach it to the Trigger.
