Player movements are key strategic elements that can make or break your gameplay experience.

On Soba, you have a few movement options:

- **Jump:** find it on the biggest round button with the arrow up ⬆️
- **Double Jump**: press twice the biggest round button with the arrow up ⬆️
- **Dash**: located above the *Jump* button with an arrow to the right ➡️
