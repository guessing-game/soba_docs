### How do I interact with other players?

You can use emotes to express yourself (or your character's feelings!) while playing Soba with [other users](https://wiki.soba.xyz/getting-started/getting-started/co-creation) in the same game. To use emotes, follow the instructions below:

1. Join a Soba game.
2. While in the game, click right above your character.
3. An emotes pop-up menu will appear on your screen. Select the emote that you wish.
