### Main controls:

- Right side of the screen controls the camera: put your right thumb on the right side and try to rotate it.
- Left side of the screen controls the character: put your left thumb on the left side and try to move around.

### Additional controls: 
Additional [controls](https://wiki.soba.xyz/getting-started/play/movements) are located in the bottom right corner of the screen. Creators can enable or disable these controls, so this means not all games would have them. 

- **Jump** & **Double Jump**: the biggest round button with the arrow up ⬆️
- **Dash**: located above the *Jump* button with an arrow to the right ➡️
- **Shoot**: located to the left of the *Jump* button and looks like a splash of paint
- **Flashlight:** located to the left of the *Jump* button and looks like a flashlight 🔦
