### Main controls:

- Right side of the screen controls the camera: put your right thumb on the right side and try to rotate it.
- Left side of the screen controls the character: put your left thumb on the left side and try to move around.

### Additional controls: 
Additional controls are located in the bottom right corner of the screen. Creators can enable or disable these controls, so this means not all games would have them. 

- **Jump** & **Double Jump**: the biggest round button with the arrow up ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
- **Dash**: located above the *Jump* button with an arrow to the right ‚û°Ô∏è
- **Shoot**: located to the left of the *Jump* button and looks like a splash of paint
