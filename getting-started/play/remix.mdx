### What does the 'remix’ button do?

In Soba, when you are in the game and tap on the menu button located in the top-right corner you will see three options: “Leave Game”, “Remix Game” and “Resume Game”.

When you select the "Remix Game" button, it creates a copy of the game you were just playing and places it into your “Your Creations” menu.

With this feature, you can copy your favorite games and then make changes to their maps or mechanics. You can also use it to understand and **learn** the game's logic by going into the [behavior editor](https://wiki.soba.xyz/creating-your-game/general/behavior-editor) and mechanics, which helps you apply these ideas in your own game creations.
