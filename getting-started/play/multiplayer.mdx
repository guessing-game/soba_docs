No! On Soba you can create both multi-player and single-player games, as well as set the maximum amount of players that can play your game at the same time. To configure such options, refer to the [How to adjust the game rule settings?](https://wiki.soba.xyz/creating-your-game/managing-your-game/rules) guide.
