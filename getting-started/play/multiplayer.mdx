No! On Soba you can create both multiplayer and single-player games, as well as set the maximum amount of players that can play your game at the same time. To configure such options, refer to the [How to adjust the game rule settings?](https://www.notion.so/How-to-adjust-the-game-rule-settings-a249e6cb3d03403a9dfb907273451c7e?pvs=21) guide.
