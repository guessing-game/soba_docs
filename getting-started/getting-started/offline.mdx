Yes, you can create on [Soba](soba.xyz) while offline. You need to open Soba when you still have a connection and load your game in Creation Mode. Continue creating your game. When re-establishing internet connection, open the game you were creating and push its new changes through the “Posting Settings” button and then “Post game". 

However, if you want to play, Soba requires an active internet connection to function and does not support offline usage.
