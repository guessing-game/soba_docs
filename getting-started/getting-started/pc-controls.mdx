|OS      |File directory |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
|Windows |`%userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\Soba Studios\Soba\config.txt`|
|macOS: |`~/Library/Application Support/com.sobastudios.sobaworld.macos/config.txt` |

### What can be changed:
- Mouse Look Sensitivity
- Mouse Wheel Zoom Speed
- UI Scale
- Master Volume

<Warning>The app must be restarted for changes to take effect.</Warning>

## Known issues:
<Note>- At this point we’re not optimising a lot of the user interface (UI), we might do this at some later point.<br />- To drag a node reliably, you have to hold the mouse button down a short time before beginning to drag.<br />- To avoid losing progress avoid opening a project on both computer and phone at the same time.<br />- If you modified a game on one device and plan to continue working on another device later, make sure that the device with the changes is able to connect to the internet before switching to the other device, so changes can be uploaded to our cloud. Your other device will then download the changes when the app starts.<br />- The game can be quit by pressing the Escape key on the game discovery. Also on Windows you can always quit Soba with Alt + F4.<br />- Behaviors can only be copied and pasted within the same game.</Note>
